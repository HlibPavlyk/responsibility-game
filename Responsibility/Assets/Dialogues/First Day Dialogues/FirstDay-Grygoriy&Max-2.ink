Here is your PC, the company makes sure that we have the most quality of the equipment. The work of the system administrator requires problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and discipline. #speaker:Max #portrait:Max #layout:right #audio:MaxVoice
I think I can work with this. #speaker:Grygoriy #portrait:Grygoriy #layout:left #audio:GrygoriyVoice
Excellent, we work by a pretty structured schedule but with a finite amount of tasks for a day, to avoid overloading. So there is always a job or a check-up to do. Once you are done with it you can have your free time, you can also repeat the check-up just to be sure. Otherwise, you can use the gym and library on the second floor. We play board games in the dormitory every Tuesday and Thursday in the evenings and you are welcome to join. #speaker:Max #portrait:Max #layout:right #audio:MaxVoice
