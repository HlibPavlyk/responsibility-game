So there is always a job or a check-up to do. Once you are done with it you can have your free time, you can also repeat the check-up just to be sure. Otherwise, you can use the gym and library on the second floor. We play board games in the dormitory every Tuesday and Thursday in the evenings and you are welcome to join.
