“3 different paintings on the wall. Assuming they are from the same author. Mañgo Armada... They really like that artist. The first one is signed as «Das Dessert zum Eiswein», it has fruits and walnuts depicted in it. The second picture is... just a dark canvas, it’s called «The true nature of light». The third one: «Look now, Morozenko, at your Ukraine!», I remember reading something like this in school”#speaker:Orest #portrait:Player #layout:left #audio:PlayerVoice
